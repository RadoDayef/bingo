# Bingo

**Bingo** is a high-performance, synchronous state-persistence engine for Flutter. It combines the speed of an in-memory cache with the reliability of a NoSQL database (Sembast).

Unlike other storage solutions, Bingo allows you to **retrieve complex objects synchronously** without `FutureBuilder` or `await` inside your build methods.
